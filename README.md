# Job Site

## Description 

This project is a Job scrapping web application using my own React template and axios to access the data from `https://remoteok.io/api` to display the job vacancies of tech jobs.

## WHY?

- More practice with REST Api's
- currently looking for a job 

## Model 
### Index


## Languages

- Html
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios
- Bootstrap 
- Babel
- Webpack

## Problems Encountered

- sending `GET` requested to the API.
- config the webpack file correctly. 

## New Skills

- Making the `GET` request server side and not client side.
- Applying `css-loader` to the Webpack file to add styling to the web app.
