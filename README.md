# Job Site

## Description 

This project is a Job scrapping web application using my own React template and axios to access the data from `https://remoteok.io/api` to display the job vacancies of tech jobs.

## WHY?

I chose to embark on this project for several reasons. First and foremost, I wanted to gain a more hands-on understanding of React, a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Additionally, I aimed to deepen my proficiency in working with REST APIs, which play a crucial role in modern web development. By combining these objectives, I saw this project as an excellent opportunity to challenge myself and explore the intricacies of React further.

Moreover, as I actively pursue employment opportunities, I recognized the importance of expanding my knowledge and enhancing my portfolio. This project not only allowed me to sharpen my skills but also provided a tangible demonstration of my capabilities to potential employers. By immersing myself in this endeavor, I aimed to not only broaden my technical expertise but also actively engage in the job market, leveraging my newfound skills to seek out and apply for relevant vacancies.
